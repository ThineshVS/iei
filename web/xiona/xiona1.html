        <p>
          Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing
          is not possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they
          don’t appear to be sick.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if
          indoors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand
          rub.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about
          vaccination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you
          cough or sneeze.
        </p>
        <p>Stay home if you feel unwell.</p>
